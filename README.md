# change-detection
The Earthâ€™s surface is constantly evolving due to natural and human-induced factors, such as urbanization, deforestation, and natural disasters. Analyzing these changes is vital for disaster response, resource management, and urban planning. Change detection, the task of identifying chages in images captured at different times, plays a critical role in monitoring such developments. Hyperspectral imaging (HSI), which captures information across dozens or hundreds of contiguous spectral bands, holds great promise in surveillance and monitoring tasks such as tracking wildfires, vegetation health assessment, and post-disaster analysis. My primary motivation comes from the recent earthquake in Myanmar, which caused significant damage. I believe that accurate change detection models can greatly aid policymakers in assessing post-disaster ground situations and planning emergency response actions effectively.

Although many change detection techniques exist, most traditional approaches are either hand-engineered or limited in their ability to extract rich spectral-spatial information from data. Existing deep learning models for change detection typically utilize multispectral or RGB data with 2D CNNs, which do not fully exploit the spectral richness offered by hyperspectral imagery. Furthermore, many models fail to generalize across regions or leverage the full spectrum of available channels. There is a gap in exploring models that can simultaneously capture spatial and spectral information, especially from hyperspectral satellite imagery.

In this project, I replicated the Fully Convolutional Network architecture proposed in [1] using the ONERA Satellite Change Detection dataset [2]. I will assess its performance with both RGB (3-channel) and full 13-channel spectral input. Building upon this, I propose to experiment with a 3D Convolutional Neural Network architecture. 3D CNNs are capable of jointly learning from spectral and spatial dimensions, potentially leading to better change detection accuracy. This will allow us to investigate whether 3D models outperform existing 2D architectures in handling hyperspectral data.
